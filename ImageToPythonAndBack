Geeks for Geeks has the best description for doing the image conversions. There are many guides out there, but they seem to prefer Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks. Those are on my list of things to do, but they don't seem to be relevant to the task at hand.



so if I begin with the end in mind, I want to output an image that is xsize x ysize.
each xy coordinate will be a color. each color will also be given an icon based on its value.

DMC threads are listed in rgb, I believe. 

# Imports
from PIL import Image # this is Pillow
from numpy import asarray
  
startimage = 'TestImagecircles.png'  
# load the image and convert into a numpy array

with Image.open(startimage) as img: 

  #display image
  #show image parameters (size, type)
  #Filter image - apply any filters or transformations, color enhancements, artsy changes
  #resize image
  #crop image
  #resize image (again, now to final size)
  #display changed image
  
  # asarray() class is used to convert PIL images into NumPy arrays
     numpydata = asarray(img)
